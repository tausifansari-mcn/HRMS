1. Backend `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.
2. Frontend `npm run build`.
3. Login as employee, HR, manager, recruiter, WFM, payroll, admin.
4. Verify `/modules` for non-admin users.
5. Verify forgot-password email.
6. Verify employee leave apply/list/balance self-scope.

8. Verify ATS command center and recruiter scope.
9. Verify payroll self-view and payroll privileged actions.
10. Verify exit flow smoke test.
