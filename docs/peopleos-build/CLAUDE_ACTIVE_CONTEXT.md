# CLAUDE_ACTIVE_CONTEXT

**Purpose:** Token-efficient active execution context for Claude Code. Read this first. Do **not** re-read the full master charter every turn unless this file is unclear, conflicts appear, or a hard gate needs interpretation.

**Last updated:** 30-May-2026

---

## 1. Permanent Execution Rule

Start every Claude instruction/work cycle with:

```text
/using-superpowers
```

Execution mode:
- Continue from latest repo state.
- Complete the next incomplete package.
- Validate with the standard full build/test gate.
- Merge if green and no hard gate exists.
- Update this file after each merge.
- Continue to the next package without routine approval.

---

## 2. Architecture Summary

- New PeopleOS business modules are **MySQL-first** using `mas_hrms` through Node/Express APIs.
- Do **not** create new operational/business Supabase tables.
- Supabase may remain transitional for Auth and Storage only.
- Existing deployed LMS is external; build integration/snapshot layer only.
- External SQL/API/file/device sources are future read-only inputs into `mas_hrms` via Integration Hub.
- Client Portal must consume approved aggregate/published data only.

---

## 3. Hard Gates — Stop and Ask

Stop before any of these:

1. SQL execution on staging/live `mas_hrms`.
2. Vercel/production deployment.
3. Hosted secret/env/credential changes.
4. External production DB connection.
5. Live LMS connection/change.
6. Payroll/statutory production activation.
7. Destructive migration or data deletion.
8. Client-visible publication without masking/approval.
9. Unresolved PII/payroll/client data exposure.

Do not stop for routine source code, additive unexecuted migrations, local tests, PR creation, green PR merge, or starting the next package.

## 4. Current Merged Baseline

Merged completed work:
- PR #12–#13: Phase 0 schema/security foundation.
- PR #14: organisation/workflow/audit foundation.
- PR #15: employee lifecycle/assets/helpdesk/letters.
- PR #16: ATS + WFM extensions/security fixes.
- PR #17/#19: payroll/F&F foundation plus safety corrections.
- PR #18: management surfaces + portal hardening.
- PR #20: Roster & Shift Governance completed and merged.
- PR #21: Attendance, Leave, WFM and RTA Completion completed and merged.
- PR #22: CEO Demo Readiness, Role Access, Account Control foundation, Workforce Mandate/Capacity foundation, CI-only validation and manual-only Vercel workflow completed and merged.

PR #22 merge SHA: `dfa17813b3aca5ad2e22b72fc06f10890b72465c`

Important PR #22 notes:
- PeopleOS CI Validation passed before merge.
- Vercel deploy workflow is manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`).
- PR validation workflow is `.github/workflows/peopleos-ci.yml`.
- Demo login still requires non-production Supabase Auth users and mapping Supabase Auth UUIDs to `mas_hrms.user_roles`; use `docs/demo/CEO_DEMO_AUTH_MAPPING_RUNBOOK.md`.

---

## 5. Current Open Work

No open active build PR is currently tracked in this context after PR #22 merge.

Next action:
1. Create the next package branch from latest `main`.
2. Begin **Frontend Role Journey Completion**.
3. Keep source-only changes until validation passes; no SQL execution and no Vercel deployment without explicit approval.

---

## 6. Deployment Workflow State

- `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml` is now **manual-only** using `workflow_dispatch`.
- PR validation is handled by `.github/workflows/peopleos-ci.yml`.
- Do not use Vercel deployment as PR validation.
- Run Vercel only manually when a demo/release URL is explicitly needed.

## 8. Standard Validation Gate

Run before every merge:

```bash
npm run build
cd backend
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Required before merge:
- frontend build pass;
- backend typecheck pass;
- all backend tests pass;
- backend production build pass;
- no SQL execution;
- no Vercel deployment unless explicitly requested;
- no external DB/LMS access;
- no secrets committed;
- no sensitive data leakage.

---

## 9. Token-Saving Rule

Use this file for normal continuation. Read the full charter only when:
- this file is incomplete;
- package scope is unclear;
- there is a conflict;
- a hard gate decision is needed;
- a new major product pillar is introduced.

After every successful package merge, update only this file with the new PR/package status and next action.
