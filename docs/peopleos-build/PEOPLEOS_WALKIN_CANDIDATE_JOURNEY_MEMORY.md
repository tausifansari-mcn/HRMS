# PeopleOS Walk-in Candidate Journey Memory

Date: 30-May-2026
Status: Mandatory product memory for ATS to HRMS lifecycle.

## Core outcomes

Walk-in candidate journey has two outcomes:

1. Selected path: registration -> checks -> screening -> assessment -> interview -> selection -> offer -> pre-joining -> document verification -> HR approval -> employee ID generation -> employee page/stat card -> training/LMS -> roster/attendance/payroll -> active employee lifecycle -> resignation workflow -> clearance/F&F/relieving.
2. Non-selected path: registration -> checks -> screening/assessment/interview -> final non-selection status -> reason captured -> communication -> cooling/reprocess status -> candidate journey closed in ATS only.

Candidate becomes an employee only after HR-approved conversion and employee ID generation. Until then, the person remains a candidate record. If final decision is not selected, employee ID, employee page, payroll mapping, roster mapping and LMS employee mapping must not be created.

## UI and architecture rules

Preserve current PeopleOS design and layout. Do not rewrite DashboardLayout broadly. Do not remove existing navigation. Do not change global theme. Use existing cards, tables, filters, forms and page shell. New pages must follow current layout pattern.

Do not create new Supabase business tables. All new business workflow data must use MySQL mas_hrms through backend APIs.

## Developer instruction

Build the Walk-in Candidate Journey exactly as documented here. Cover selected -> joined -> employee page -> training/roster/payroll -> resignation/clearance/F&F/relieving, and non-selected -> reason captured -> communication -> cooling/reprocess -> ATS-only closure. Candidate becomes employee only after HR-approved conversion, mandatory checks and employee ID generation. Preserve current UI/layout, enforce backend role/scope checks, write journey events, audit sensitive actions, and protect Employee Page as mandatory after joining.
