# PeopleOS Complete Role Mindmap, Journey, Manager Mapping and Scenario Blueprint

**Status:** Approved role blueprint  
**Purpose:** Developer-ready role blueprint for PeopleOS  
**Architecture:** React + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express backend, MySQL `mas_hrms`  
**Design rule:** Preserve current PeopleOS UI/layout. Do not rewrite existing layout or theme.

---

## 1. Global Identity and Manager Rule

### 1.1 Every internal user is an Employee entity

Every internal person inside PeopleOS must have an Employee record and Employee Page / Stat Card.

This includes:

```text
CEO / Leadership
Super Admin
HR Admin
HR Recruiter
Branch Head
Process Manager
Assistant Manager
Team Leader
Agent / Analyst
QA / T&Q
Trainer
WFM / RTM
SME
Payroll / Finance
Admin / IT / Asset user
Compliance / Auditor
Support Staff
```

External client users are **not internal employees** unless they are actually employed by MAS Callnet.

---

### 1.2 Mandatory manager rule

```text
CEO / Top Organisation Head = reporting manager not required
Every other internal employee = reporting manager mandatory
```

Before joining, a candidate does not have an employee reporting manager. They must have a mapped candidate owner:

```text
Candidate before joining = Recruiter / HR Owner mandatory
Candidate after employee conversion = Reporting Manager mandatory
```

---

### 1.3 Employee Page is mandatory

Every internal employee must have:

```text
Employee ID
Employee Page / Employee Stat Card
Current designation
Designation history
System role
Reporting manager
Branch / Client / Process / LOB / Cost Centre mapping
Manager / TL / AM / PM hierarchy
Employee journey timeline
```

Important distinction:

```text
Designation = business title
Example: HR Recruiter, Analyst, TL, AM, QA, Trainer

System Role = application access role
Example: recruiter, employee, tl, process_manager, hr_admin
```

Both must be visible separately.

---

### 1.4 Manager validation rules

While creating or updating an employee:

```text
If designation is CEO / Top Organisation Head:
→ reporting manager can be blank

For all other designations:
→ reporting manager is mandatory
```

Validation:

```text
Reporting manager must be an active employee.
Reporting manager cannot be the same employee.
Reporting hierarchy must not create a loop.
Reporting manager must be within valid branch/process/department scope or have approved cross-scope mapping.
Manager change must create employee_assignment_history.
Manager change must create employee_journey_event.
```

If missing:

```text
Do not fully activate the employee profile.
Show blocker: Reporting manager is mandatory.
```

---

## 2. Role List Covered

```text
1. CEO / Top Organisation Head
2. Super Admin
3. HR Admin
4. HR Recruiter

# 3. CEO / Top Organisation Head

## 3.1 Mindmap

```text
CEO
├─ Leadership Dashboard
│  ├─ Company health
│  ├─ Branch performance
│  ├─ Process performance
│  ├─ LOB / cost centre view
│  ├─ Hiring pipeline
│  ├─ Training pipeline
│  ├─ Staffing shortage
│  ├─ Roster risk
│  ├─ Attendance / shrinkage

   ├─ LOB
   ├─ Cost centre
   ├─ Team
   └─ Employee drilldown where permitted
```

## 3.2 Journey

```text
CEO logs in
→ Sees organisation-wide dashboard
→ Reviews exception/risk cards
→ Drills into branch/process/LOB/cost centre
→ Assigns action to owner
→ Tracks closure
→ Reviews compliance and client risk
```

## 3.3 Scenarios

| Scenario | What happens next |
|---|---|
| Process HC shortage is high | CEO drills down to shortage reason and asks HR/WFM/PM for action. |
| Attrition spike | CEO reviews branch/process/tenure/manager trend and asks HR/PM for action plan. |
| Client SLA risk | CEO checks client governance action and Process Manager ownership. |
| Payroll cost anomaly | CEO sees summary only; payroll details remain restricted. |
| DPDP breach incident | CEO sees incident status; compliance/legal owner handles formal workflow. |

## 3.4 Access and compliance

```text
CEO does not require reporting manager.
CEO can see aggregate and leadership drilldowns.
Highly sensitive payroll/document/DPDP details should still follow masking/approval rules.
Client PII and employee sensitive data should be controlled.
All leadership exports must be logged.
```

## 4.2 Journey

```text
Super Admin created as employee
→ Employee Page created
→ Designation assigned
→ System role super_admin assigned
→ Reporting manager mapped unless Super Admin is also CEO
→ Platform access enabled
→ Maintains masters, roles, scopes and system config
```

## 4.3 Scenarios

| Scenario | What happens next |
|---|---|
| New branch required | Create Branch Master in Draft, assign owners, policies, process mappings, then activate. |
| User cannot access page | Check role, page access, backend scope, employee status, account lock. |
| User needs password reset | Trigger admin reset, force password change, write audit log. |
| Role changed | Update system role, audit action, reflect in Employee Page. |
| Master record linked to data | Do not remove; deactivate/close/archive instead. |

# 21. Global Role Completion Criteria

A role journey is complete only when:

```text
1. Role has Employee Page / Stat Card if internal.
2. Reporting manager is mapped, except CEO.
3. Designation and system role are visible separately.
4. Role has dashboard/workbench where needed.
5. Role sees only mapped branch/process/LOB/cost-centre/team/self/client scope.
6. Backend enforces role/scope.
7. Sensitive fields are masked.
8. Workflow actions create audit logs.
9. Notifications trigger where required.
10. Employee journey timeline updates where relevant.
11. Current UI/layout is preserved.
12. Tests cover success, unauthorized and scope-denied cases.
```

# 22. Developer Instruction

```text
Build every role as an Employee entity if internal. Every internal employee must have a reporting/mandate manager except CEO/top organisation head. Candidate before joining must have Recruiter/HR owner, not employee manager. Each role must have Employee Page/Stat Card, designation, system role, manager mapping, scope mapping, role dashboard/workbench, scenario handling, audit, notification and data masking. Client users are external and aggregate-only by default. Preserve current UI/layout and do not create new Supabase business tables.
```
