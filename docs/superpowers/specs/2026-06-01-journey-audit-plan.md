# MAS-CallNet HRMS — Post-Completion Journey Audit Plan

**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Purpose:** Structured end-to-end validation of every user role and business flow. Each section is a self-contained test session — one person, one role, real data, DB verification after every action.

---

## How to Run Each Audit

1. Log in using the demo credentials from the login page "Test Credentials by Role" panel
2. Execute every step in order
3. After each DB-write action, verify in MySQL: `SELECT ... FROM <table> ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`
4. Mark each step ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial
5. Log failures in a GitHub Issue tagged `[journey-audit]`

DB connection for verification:
```bash
node -e "
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
(async () => {
  const c = await mysql.createConnection({ host:'192.168.10.6', port:3306, user:'shivam_user', password:'qwersdfg!@#hjk', database:'mas_hrms' });
  const [r] = await c.query('YOUR QUERY HERE');
  console.log(r);
  await c.end();
})();
"
```

## Audit Completion Checklist

Before signing off each journey:
- [ ] All DB writes verified directly in MySQL
- [ ] No `console.error` in browser devtools for the journey
- [ ] All pages load within 3s on local network
- [ ] Role boundaries enforced (try accessing a page from wrong role — should get 403/redirect)
- [ ] Mobile view (375px) renders correctly for key pages

## Known Gaps (Phases 3/4/6/7 — awaiting decisions)

These journeys are partially functional but will be improved after decisions are made:

| Gap | Phase | Blocked on |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Backend authorization scope enforcement (process/branch isolation) | Phase 3 | Role matrix approval |
| Public candidate registration uses authenticated endpoints | Phase 4 | Public intake API design |
| Frontend page gates (Gate component seeding) | Phase 6 | Phase 2 completion + page code seed |
| DPDP consent text, retention scheduler | Phase 7 | Legal counsel input |
