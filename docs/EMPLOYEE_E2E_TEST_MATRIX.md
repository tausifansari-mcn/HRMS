## Implementation Notes

### Adding data-testid Attributes

For robust automation, add the following `data-testid` attributes to the frontend:

```html
<!-- Auth -->
data-testid="login-form"
data-testid="login-email-input"
data-testid="login-password-input"
data-testid="login-submit-button"
data-testid="forgot-password-link"
data-testid="demo-login-button"

<!-- Navigation -->
data-testid="sidebar-nav"
data-testid="nav-dashboard"
data-testid="nav-attendance"
data-testid="nav-leaves"
data-testid="nav-profile"
data-testid="logout-button"

<!-- Common -->
data-testid="page-header"
data-testid="submit-button"
data-testid="cancel-button"
data-testid="save-button"
data-testid="loading-spinner"
data-testid="error-message"
data-testid="success-toast"
```

### Playwright Test Pattern

```typescript
// Example test pattern for Employee flow
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Employee Attendance', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/auth');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="login-email-input"]', 'employee@mascallnet.com');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="login-password-input"]', 'Employee@1');
    await page.click('[data-testid="login-submit-button"]');
    await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');
  });

  test('EMP-ATT-03: Clock in functionality', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/attendance');
    await page.click('[data-testid="clock-in-button"]');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-toast"]')).toContainText('Clocked in');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="clock-status"]')).toContainText('Clocked In');
  });
});
```

### Backend Test Pattern

```typescript
// Example Vitest + supertest pattern
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import request from 'supertest';
import { app } from '../src/app';

describe('Employee Leave APIs', () => {
  it('API-LEAVE-02: Create leave request', async () => {
    const loginRes = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send({ email: 'employee@mascallnet.com', password: 'Employee@1' });
    
    const token = loginRes.body.accessToken;
    
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/leave/requests')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .send({
        typeId: 'annual-leave',
        startDate: '2026-06-15',
        endDate: '2026-06-16',
        reason: 'Personal work'
      });
    
    expect(res.status).toBe(201);
    expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('id');
  });
});
```
