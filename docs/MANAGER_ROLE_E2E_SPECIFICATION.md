## 3. Backend API Endpoints

### 3.1 Manager-Accessible Routes

| Module | Route | Method | Middleware | Description |

| `leave` | `/requests/:id/review` | PATCH | `admin, hr, manager` | Approve/reject leave |
| `employees` | `/stats` | GET | `admin, hr, manager, ceo` | Aggregate stats |
| `employees` | `/` | GET | `admin, hr, manager` | List employees (scoped) |

| `employees` | `/:id/journey` | GET | `admin, hr, manager` | Journey log |
| `goals` | `/appraisal/ratings/:cycleId/:employeeId/manager` | POST | `admin, hr, manager` | Submit manager rating |
| `wfm` | `/attendance-policy/:employeeId` | GET | `admin, wfm, manager` | Attendance policy |
| `wfm` | `/shifts` | GET | `admin, wfm, manager` | List shifts |
| `wfm` | `/sessions` | GET | `admin, wfm, manager` | Attendance sessions |

| `workflow` | `/requests/pending` | GET | `admin, hr, manager, tl` | Pending inbox |
| `workflow` | `/requests/:id/act` | POST | `admin, hr, manager, tl` | Take action |

### 3.2 TL-Accessible Routes

| Module | Route | Method | Middleware | Description |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|
| `workflow` | `/requests/pending` | GET | `admin, hr, manager, tl` | Pending inbox |
| `workflow` | `/requests/:id/act` | POST | `admin, hr, manager, tl` | Take action |
| `wfm` | `/shifts` | GET | `admin, wfm, manager` | Indirect via page access |

## 4. Scope Enforcement Rules

### 4.1 Manager Scope

- **Default scope type**: `process` (process-level filtering)
- **Scope filter applied**: `branchId`, `processId`, `departmentId`, `managerEmployeeId`
- **Behavior**: Manager sees only employees in their process/branch, or direct reports
- **Row-level enforcement**: `buildScopeWhereClause()` in employee routes

### 4.2 Team Leader Scope

- **Default scope type**: `team` (team-level filtering)
- **Scope filter applied**: Direct reports only (`reporting_manager_id`)
- **Behavior**: TL sees only their direct reports

### 4.3 Negative Tests Required

| Test | Role | Expected Behavior |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Access customization rules | Manager | 403 or page hidden |
| Approve auto-roster plan | Manager (not process_manager) | 403 |
| Edit employee outside scope | Manager | 403 or not returned in list |
| Access admin dashboard | TL | Redirect or 403 |
| Access finance/payroll | Manager | Page hidden / 403 |

---

## 5. Test Infrastructure

- **Framework**: Playwright (Chromium only)
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Session injection**: `injectDemoSession(page, "manager")` or `injectDemoSession(page, "tl")`
- **Helpers**: `e2e/helpers.ts` — `gotoSmoke()`, `assertNotCrashed()`, `waitForAppShell()`
- **Retries**: 1 in CI, 0 local
- **Workers**: 1 (sequential)

## 6. Gap Analysis

| Gap | Severity | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| No manager smoke tests | Critical | Only TL smoke exists in `e2e/smoke.smoke.ts` |
| No management dashboard E2E | High | `/management/dashboard` completely untested |
| No team analytics E2E | High | `/team-analytics` completely untested |
| No scope enforcement E2E | High | Manager/TL could see data outside their scope |
| No negative tests | Medium | No tests verifying what manager/TL CANNOT do |
| No performance review E2E | Medium | Manager rating submission untested end-to-end |
| No workflow inbox E2E | Medium | `/work-inbox` untested for manager/TL |
