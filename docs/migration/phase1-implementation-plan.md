# Phase 1: Core Migration Implementation Plan

**Duration**: Weeks 1-3  
**Goal**: Migrate core employee data + salary structures to make HRMS payroll-ready  
**Start Date**: 2026-06-01

---

## Pre-Migration Setup

### 1. Database Backup
```bash
# Backup legacy db_bill
mysqldump -u root -p db_bill > db_bill_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Backup current mas_hrms (if any data exists)
mysqldump -u root -p mas_hrms > mas_hrms_pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### 2. Create Migration Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mas_hrms_migration;
USE mas_hrms_migration;

-- Migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE migration_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  phase VARCHAR(50),
  entity VARCHAR(100),
  legacy_id VARCHAR(50),
  new_id VARCHAR(36),
  status ENUM('pending', 'success', 'failed', 'skipped'),
  error_message TEXT,
  migrated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_entity_legacy (entity, legacy_id),
  INDEX idx_status (status)
);

-- Data quality issues
CREATE TABLE migration_issues (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  entity VARCHAR(100),
  legacy_id VARCHAR(50),
  issue_type VARCHAR(50),
  severity ENUM('critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low'),
  description TEXT,
  resolution VARCHAR(255),
  resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Week 1: Master Data Migration

### Task 1.1: Branch Master (Day 1)

**Source**: `masjclrentry.BranchName` (distinct values)  
**Target**: `branch_master`

**Migration Script**:
```sql
-- Extract unique branches
INSERT INTO mas_hrms.branch_master (id, branch_name, branch_code, is_active, created_at)
SELECT 
  UUID() as id,
  TRIM(BranchName) as branch_name,
  UPPER(REPLACE(TRIM(BranchName), ' ', '_')) as branch_code,
  1 as is_active,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT BranchName 
  FROM db_bill.masjclrentry 
  WHERE BranchName IS NOT NULL 
    AND BranchName != ''
    AND Status = 'Active'
) branches
ORDER BY BranchName;

-- Log migration
INSERT INTO mas_hrms_migration.migration_log (phase, entity, status)
VALUES ('Phase1', 'branch_master', 'success');
```

**Validation**:
```sql
-- Count check
SELECT 'Legacy' as source, COUNT(DISTINCT BranchName) as count 
FROM db_bill.masjclrentry WHERE Status='Active'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'HRMS' as source, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM mas_hrms.branch_master WHERE is_active=1;

-- Should match
```

---

### Task 1.2: Client Master (Day 1)

**Source**: `masjclrentry.ClientName`

```sql
INSERT INTO mas_hrms.client_master (id, client_name, client_code, is_active, created_at)
SELECT 
  UUID() as id,
  TRIM(ClientName) as client_name,
  UPPER(REPLACE(TRIM(ClientName), ' ', '_')) as client_code,
  1 as is_active,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT ClientName 
  FROM db_bill.masjclrentry 
  WHERE ClientName IS NOT NULL 
    AND ClientName != ''
    AND Status = 'Active'
) clients
ORDER BY ClientName;

INSERT INTO mas_hrms_migration.migration_log (phase, entity, status)
VALUES ('Phase1', 'client_master', 'success');
```

SELECT 
  UUID() as id,
  TRIM(m.Process) as process_name,
  UPPER(REPLACE(TRIM(m.Process), ' ', '_')) as process_code,
  c.id as client_id,
  1 as is_active,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Process, ClientName 
  FROM db_bill.masjclrentry 
  WHERE Process IS NOT NULL 
    AND Process != ''
    AND Status = 'Active'
) m
LEFT JOIN mas_hrms.client_master c ON TRIM(m.ClientName) = c.client_name
ORDER BY m.Process;
```

---

  UPPER(REPLACE(TRIM(Desgination), ' ', '_')) as designation_code,
  NULL as level,  -- To be filled manually
  1 as is_active,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Desgination 
  FROM db_bill.masjclrentry 
  WHERE Desgination IS NOT NULL 
    AND Desgination != ''
    AND Status = 'Active'

GROUP BY EmpCode
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Action: Deduplicate (keep latest by CreateDate)

-- Check 3: Invalid DOJ (future dates or before 1970)
SELECT EmpCode, EmpName, DOJ
FROM db_bill.masjclrentry

SELECT COUNT(*) as no_statutory
FROM db_bill.masjclrentry
WHERE Status = 'Active'
  AND CTC < 21000  -- ESIC eligible
  AND (ESICNo IS NULL OR ESICNo = '');
-- Action: Flag for registration

-- Log all issues
INSERT INTO mas_hrms_migration.migration_issues (entity, legacy_id, issue_type, severity, description)
SELECT 'employee', EmpCode, 'missing_bank', 'critical', 
       CONCAT('No bank details for ', EmpName)
FROM db_bill.masjclrentry

## Week 3: Salary Structures Migration

### Task 3.1: Create Salary Components (Day 9)

```sql
-- Standard components
INSERT INTO mas_hrms.salary_component_master (id, component_code, component_name, component_type, is_statutory, calculation_type, is_active)

### Task 3.2: Migrate Salary Structures (Day 10-12)

**Strategy**: Extract latest salary structure per employee from `salary_master`

```sql
-- Create salary structures
INSERT INTO mas_hrms.salary_structure (id, employee_id, effective_from, is_active, created_at)
SELECT 
  UUID() as id,
  e.id as employee_id,

  1 as is_active,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM (
  -- Get latest salary record per employee
  SELECT 
    EmpCode,
    FinanceYear,
    FinanceMonth,
    MAX(Id) as latest_id
  FROM db_bill.salary_master
  GROUP BY EmpCode
) latest
JOIN db_bill.salary_master s ON s.Id = latest.latest_id
JOIN mas_hrms.employees e ON e.employee_code = s.EmpCode;

-- Migrate salary components for each structure
INSERT INTO mas_hrms.salary_structure_component (id, structure_id, component_id, amount, created_at)
SELECT 
  UUID() as id,

      WHEN 'BONUS' THEN NULLIF(TRIM(s.Bonus), '')
    END, '0') AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as amount,
  NOW() as created_at
FROM db_bill.salary_master s
JOIN mas_hrms.employees e ON e.employee_code = s.EmpCode
JOIN mas_hrms.salary_structure ss ON ss.employee_id = e.id AND ss.is_active = 1
CROSS JOIN mas_hrms.salary_component_master sc

      WHEN 'BONUS' THEN NULLIF(TRIM(s.Bonus), '')
    END, '0') AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 0;
```

---

### Task 3.3: Validation (Day 13)

```sql
-- Verify all active employees have salary structure
SELECT e.employee_code, e.full_name
FROM mas_hrms.employees e
LEFT JOIN mas_hrms.salary_structure ss ON e.id = ss.employee_id AND ss.is_active = 1
WHERE e.status = 'active'
  AND ss.id IS NULL;
-- Should be empty

-- Sample salary comparison
SELECT 
  e.employee_code,
  e.full_name,
  CAST(s.Basic AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as legacy_basic,
  ssc.amount as hrms_basic,
  CAST(s.Gross AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as legacy_gross,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM mas_hrms.salary_structure_component 
   WHERE structure_id = ss.id) as hrms_gross
FROM db_bill.salary_master s
JOIN mas_hrms.employees e ON e.employee_code = s.EmpCode
JOIN mas_hrms.salary_structure ss ON ss.employee_id = e.id AND ss.is_active = 1
JOIN mas_hrms.salary_structure_component ssc ON ssc.structure_id = ss.id
JOIN mas_hrms.salary_component_master sc ON sc.id = ssc.component_id AND sc.component_code = 'BASIC'
WHERE e.status = 'active'
LIMIT 20;
```

## Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] All active employees migrated (count match)
- [ ] All master tables populated (branch, client, process, designation, cost centre)
- [ ] All employees have branch/client/process FKs
- [ ] All employees have bank details (or flagged as missing)
- [ ] All employees have statutory numbers (or flagged as missing)
- [ ] All active employees have salary structures
- [ ] Sample salary calculations validated
- [ ] Migration logs show 100% success rate
- [ ] Migration issues reviewed and resolved
- [ ] Legacy database kept read-only

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

```sql
-- Rollback employee migration
DELETE FROM mas_hrms.employees WHERE created_at > '[MIGRATION_START_TIMESTAMP]';

-- Rollback masters
DELETE FROM mas_hrms.branch_master WHERE created_at > '[MIGRATION_START_TIMESTAMP]';
DELETE FROM mas_hrms.client_master WHERE created_at > '[MIGRATION_START_TIMESTAMP]';
-- ... other masters

-- Check migration_log for details
SELECT * FROM mas_hrms_migration.migration_log WHERE phase = 'Phase1' AND status = 'failed';
```

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

After Phase 1 complete:
- Build Training Module (Week 4-5)
- Test first payroll run with migrated data
- Collect missing bank/statutory details
- User acceptance testing
