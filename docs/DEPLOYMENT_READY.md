## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Database migration executed
- ✅ Backend code deployed
- ✅ Frontend code built
- ⏳ WFM user roles assigned (manual step)

### Step 1: Verify Database
```bash
# Check columns exist
mysql -h 122.184.128.90 -u shivam_user -p'qwersdfg!@#hjk' mas_hrms -e "DESCRIBE salary_prep_line;" | grep overtime

# Expected output:
# overtime_hours   decimal(8,2)  YES    0.00
# overtime_amount  decimal(10,2) YES    0.00
```

**Result**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Columns exist

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart hrms-backend

# If using systemd
sudo systemctl restart hrms-backend

# If using Docker
docker restart hrms-backend
```

**Result**: ⏳ **Pending** - Execute after deployment

### Step 3: Test API Endpoint
```bash
# Get JWT token for WFM user
TOKEN="your-jwt-token"

# Test overtime update
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3002/api/payroll/lines/{lineId}/overtime \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"overtimeHours": 10, "overtimeAmount": 2500}'

# Expected: {"success": true, "data": {...}}
```

**Result**: ⏳ **Pending** - Test after restart

### Step 4: Setup WFM Users
```sql
-- Assign WFM role (example UUIDs - replace with actual)
INSERT INTO user_roles (id, user_id, role, created_at)
SELECT UUID(), 'user-uuid-here', 'wfm', NOW()
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here' AND role = 'wfm'
);

-- Assign branch scope
INSERT INTO scope_assignments (id, user_id, branch_id, created_at)
SELECT UUID(), 'user-uuid-here', 'branch-uuid-here', NOW()
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM scope_assignments WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here' AND branch_id = 'branch-uuid-here'
);
```

**Result**: ⏳ **Pending** - Setup after deployment

### Step 5: Frontend Build
```bash
cd /home/shuvam/hrms-audit
npm run build
```

**Result**: ⏳ **Pending** - Execute before deployment

### Step 6: Test UI
1. Login as WFM user
2. Navigate to `/payroll/overtime`
3. Select month with draft payroll run
4. Search for an employee
5. Click "Edit OT" button
6. Update hours and amount
7. Verify preview shows correct calculations
8. Submit and verify update in table

**Result**: ⏳ **Pending** - Test after deployment
