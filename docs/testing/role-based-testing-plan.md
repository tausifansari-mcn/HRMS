## Cross-Role Validation Tests

### Test: Data Isolation

```
Setup:

- Employee B (Team 2, Manager Y)
- Manager X logs in

Test:
- [ ] Manager X views attendance → Should see Employee A, NOT Employee B
- [ ] Manager X views leaves → Should see Employee A requests, NOT Employee B
- [ ] Manager X tries to approve Employee B leave → Should fail (403 or hidden)

Setup:
- Client C1 (Process P1)
- Client C2 (Process P2)
- Client C1 logs in

Test:
- [ ] Client C1 views KPIs → Should see Process P1 only, NOT Process P2
- [ ] Client C1 tries to navigate to Process P2 → Should fail or redirect
```

### Test: Permission Escalation

```
Test:
- [ ] Employee logs in
- [ ] Manually navigate to `/settings` (URL hack) → Expect 403 or redirect
- [ ] Manually navigate to `/payroll/runs` → Expect 403
- [ ] Use browser DevTools to call admin API: POST /api/org/branches → Expect 401/403

Test:
- [ ] Manager logs in
- [ ] API call: GET /api/employees (all employees) → Should return team only
- [ ] API call: POST /api/payroll/runs → Expect 403

Test:
- [ ] Client logs in
- [ ] API call: GET /api/employees → Expect 403
- [ ] API call: GET /api/portal/kpi (other client's process) → Expect 403
```

## Backend API Testing

### Authentication Endpoints
```bash
# Test login
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { email: "admin@shivu.ai", password: "admin123" }
Expected: 200 + JWT token

# Test invalid credentials
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { email: "admin@shivu.ai", password: "wrong" }
Expected: 401

# Test portal OTP
POST /api/portal/auth/request-otp
Body: { email: "demo@mascallnet.com" }
Expected: 200 (OTP sent)

POST /api/portal/auth/verify-otp
Body: { email: "demo@mascallnet.com", otp: "123456" }
Expected: 200 + JWT token (process-scoped)
```

### RBAC Middleware Tests
```bash
# Test admin-only endpoint (as HR user)
GET /api/org/branches
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <hr_token>" }
Expected: 403 Forbidden

# Test admin-only endpoint (as admin)
GET /api/org/branches
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <admin_token>" }
Expected: 200 + branches list

# Test team-scoped endpoint (as manager)
GET /api/employees
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <manager_token>" }
Expected: 200 + team employees only (not all)

# Test self-only endpoint (as employee)
GET /api/payroll/payslips
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <employee_token>" }
Expected: 200 + own payslips only
```

## Frontend RBAC Tests

### Navigation Menu Rendering
```javascript
// Test: Admin sees all nav items
Login as admin → Check sidebar
Expected: All sections visible (Employees, Payroll, Settings, Migration)

// Test: HR doesn't see admin items
Login as HR → Check sidebar
Expected: Settings, Migration Console hidden

// Test: Manager sees limited menu
Login as manager → Check sidebar
Expected: Team-related items only (Attendance, Leave, Performance)

// Test: Employee sees minimal menu
Login as employee → Check sidebar
Expected: Self-service only (My Attendance, My Leaves, My Payroll)

// Test: Client sees portal menu only
Login as client → Check layout
Expected: Separate portal layout (KPI, Glidepath, Action Plans)
```

### Page Access Guards
```javascript
// Check ProtectedRoute wrapper
- [ ] All /admin/* routes wrapped with requireRole(['admin'])
- [ ] All /hr/* routes wrapped with requireRole(['admin', 'hr'])
- [ ] All /portal/* routes wrapped with PortalRoute

// Check conditional rendering
- [ ] "Add Employee" button: visible for admin/hr, hidden for manager/employee
- [ ] "Create Payroll Run" button: visible for admin/hr, hidden for others
- [ ] "Edit Salary" action: visible for admin/hr, hidden for others
```

# Test Execution Log

## Date: 2026-06-01

### Admin Tests
- [x] Dashboard access: PASS
- [x] Employee CRUD: PASS
- [x] Payroll runs: PASS
- [x] Settings access: PASS
- [x] Migration console: PASS

### HR Tests
- [ ] Dashboard access: PENDING
- [ ] Employee CRUD: PENDING
...

### Issues Found
1. Manager sees all employees (should see team only) - HIGH
2. Employee can access `/payroll/runs` via URL hack - CRITICAL

**Total Estimated Testing Time**: 5-7 days (full manual testing)

**Priority Order**:
1. Admin + HR (core functionality)
2. Manager (data isolation critical)
3. Employee (self-service validation)
4. Client Portal (process-scoped validation)
5. Backend API (RBAC enforcement)
