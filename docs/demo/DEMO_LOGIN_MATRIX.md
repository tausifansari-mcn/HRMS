## How to Run Demo Seed (non-production only)
```bash
ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=true PEOPLEOS_DEMO_PASSWORD=Demo@12345! node -e "
  import('./dist/modules/demo/demo.seed.js').then(m => m.runDemoSeed().then(console.log))
"

## Security Notes
- Demo passwords are NEVER stored in MySQL
- Supabase Auth manages actual authentication
- MySQL tracks user_id → role mapping and force_change_password flag only
- All account control actions are audit-logged in account_control_log
