## 3. Known Gaps

### 3.1 Critical Issues

#### Gap #1: Admin Bypass Vulnerability
- **Location**: `backend/src/utils/scopeAccess.ts`
- **Issue**: `allowAdminBypass: true` default
- **Impact**: Any admin role bypasses all scope checks
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical
- **Status**: Open

#### Gap #2: WFM/Roster Phase 6 Deferred
- **Location**: `backend/src/middleware/`
- **Issue**: 3 middleware functions needed for roster scope
- **Impact**: Roster module lacks complete scope enforcement
- **Priority**: P1 - High
- **Status**: Deferred

### 3.2 List API Gaps

| Module | API | Issue | Risk |
|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Employee | GET /api/employees | buildScopeWhereClause partially implemented | Medium |
| ATS | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| Payroll | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| Leave | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| Attendance | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| WFM | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| Exit | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | High |
| Assets | All list APIs | No scope WHERE clause | Medium |
| Reports | Custom SQL | Scope not injected | Critical |

### 3.3 Detail API Gaps

| Module | API | Issue | Risk |
|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Employee | GET /api/employees/:id | No hasScopedAccess check | Critical |
| ATS | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| Payroll | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| Leave | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| Attendance | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| WFM | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| Exit | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | High |
| Assets | All detail APIs | No hasScopedAccess check | Medium |

### 3.4 Create/Update API Gaps

| Module | API | Issue | Risk |
|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Employee | POST /api/employees | No target branch validation | Critical |
| Employee | PUT /api/employees/:id | No source/target branch validation | Critical |
| Movement | POST /api/movements | No source/target branch validation | Critical |
| All | Create APIs | Missing branch scope validation | High |
| All | Update APIs | Missing source/target validation | High |

### 3.5 Export API Gaps

| Module | API | Issue | Risk |
|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Employee | POST /api/employees/export | Partial implementation | Medium |
| All | Export APIs | Scope not enforced consistently | High |
| Reports | Custom exports | SQL injection + scope bypass risk | Critical |

### 3.6 KPI/Dashboard Gaps

| Module | KPI | Issue | Risk |
|--------|-----|-------|------|
| Dashboard | All KPIs | No branch filter | High |
| Employee | Counts | KPI counts don't match drilldown | Medium |
| All | Dashboard APIs | Branch filter not applied | High |

## 4. Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. Fix admin bypass vulnerability in `scopeAccess.ts`
2. Add hasScopedAccess check to Employee detail API
3. Add branch validation to Employee create/update

### Phase 2: Core Modules (Week 1-2)
1. Employee module - complete scope enforcement
2. Dashboard - fix KPI branch filtering
3. Export operations - consistent scope

### Phase 3: Secondary Modules (Week 2)
1. Leave Management
2. Attendance
3. Assets & Helpdesk

### Phase 4: Complex Modules (Week 3)
1. ATS/Recruitment
2. Payroll
3. Exit Management
4. Onboarding

### Phase 5: Advanced (Week 4)
1. WFM/Roster (3 middleware functions)
2. Reports (custom SQL scope)
3. Movement (dual branch validation)
