# Migration Plan: mas_hrms as Source of Truth

**Date**: 2026-06-12  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - db_bill → mas_hrms sync (ACTIVE)  
**Target Phase**: Phase 2 - mas_hrms = Source of Truth (FUTURE)

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

### **Current State (Phase 1)**
```
db_bill (14.97.30.236)                   mas_hrms (122.184.128.90)
   ├── Salary data entered           ──────→  ├── Synced daily
   ├── Manual payroll processing              ├── HRMS application
   └── Source of truth (CURRENT)              └── Read-only replica
```

**Issue**: Dual data entry, manual process, sync delays

### **Target State (Phase 2)**
```
mas_hrms (122.184.128.90)                db_bill (14.97.30.236)
   ├── Salary data entered           ──────→  ├── Legacy archive
   ├── Automated payroll processing           ├── Historical reference
   └── Source of truth (FUTURE)               └── Sync DISABLED
```

**Benefit**: Single source of truth, automated, real-time, no sync needed

---

## 🎯 **Migration Objectives**

1. **Eliminate dual data entry** - HR enters salary data once (in mas_hrms)
2. **Remove sync dependency** - No more db_bill → mas_hrms sync
3. **Enable real-time payroll** - Instant payslip availability
4. **Reduce manual work** - Automated salary processing
5. **Improve data accuracy** - Single source eliminates inconsistency

---

## 📊 **Current Sync Status**

### **Auto-Sync Configuration**

**Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM  
**Mode**: Delta sync (last 2 months)  
**Status**: ✅ ENABLED  
**Toggle File**: `/home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/.sync-enabled`

## 🗺️ **Migration Phases**

### **Phase 1: Dual System (CURRENT) - Duration: 3-6 months**

**Period**: June 2026 - Dec 2026  
**Status**: ✅ **IN PROGRESS**

**Activities**:
1. ✅ db_bill continues as primary entry point
2. ✅ Auto-sync runs daily (db_bill → mas_hrms)

4. ✅ HR team validates mas_hrms accuracy
5. ✅ Parallel data verification

**Sync Settings**:
- **Enabled**: YES
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Direction**: db_bill → mas_hrms (ONE WAY)

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Data accuracy verified (100% match)
- [ ] All employees can view payslips in mas_hrms
- [ ] HR team comfortable with mas_hrms interface
- [ ] No sync-related issues reported

---

### **Phase 2: Parallel Entry (TRANSITION) - Duration: 2-3 months**

**Period**: Jan 2027 - Mar 2027  
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING**

**Activities**:
1. Train HR team on mas_hrms payroll module
2. Set up salary processing workflows in mas_hrms
3. Enter NEW salaries in BOTH systems (parallel validation)
4. Compare outputs monthly (mas_hrms vs db_bill)
5. Document any discrepancies and fix

**Sync Settings**:
- **Enabled**: YES (still syncing db_bill → mas_hrms for old data)
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Direction**: db_bill → mas_hrms (ONE WAY)
- **New Data**: Entered in BOTH systems

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] HR team trained on mas_hrms
- [ ] 2+ months of parallel entry (100% match)
- [ ] Workflow automation tested
- [ ] Approval processes working

### **Phase 3: mas_hrms Primary (CUTOVER) - Duration: 1 month**

**Period**: Apr 2027  
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING**

**Activities**:
1. **CUTOVER DATE**: April 1, 2027 (start of financial year Q1)
2. Stop entering salary data in db_bill
3. mas_hrms becomes primary salary entry system
4. Keep sync ENABLED for 1 month (safety net)
5. Monitor for any issues

**Sync Settings**:
- **Enabled**: YES (safety net only)
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Direction**: db_bill → mas_hrms (ONE WAY)

**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING**

**Activities**:
1. **DISABLE SYNC** - Remove `.sync-enabled` file
2. Archive db_bill salary data (historical reference only)
3. Update all integrations to use mas_hrms
4. Set db_bill to read-only mode
5. Celebrate! 🎉

**Sync Settings**:
- **Enabled**: ❌ **NO** (sync disabled permanently)
- **Direction**: N/A (no sync)
- **db_bill Status**: Read-only archive

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Sync disabled (`.sync-enabled` removed)
- [ ] 1+ month of mas_hrms-only operation
- [ ] No sync-related issues

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Current Sync Architecture**

```bash
# Cron job (runs daily at 2:00 AM)
/home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/run-sync-cron.sh

# Script checks for toggle file
if [ -f .sync-enabled ]; then
    # Run sync
    node db_bill-to-mas_hrms-salary-sync.js --mode=delta --months=2
else
    # Sync disabled - exit
    echo "Sync DISABLED - mas_hrms is source of truth"
    exit 0
fi
```

### **How to Disable Sync (Phase 4)**

```bash
# Step 1: Remove toggle file
rm /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/.sync-enabled

# Step 2: Verify sync is disabled
tail -f /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/logs/sync-auto-*.log
# Should see: "Sync DISABLED - mas_hrms is now source of truth"

# Step 3: Optional - Remove cron job
crontab -e
# Comment out or remove the line containing "run-sync-cron.sh"
```

### **How to Re-enable Sync (If Needed)**

```bash
# Emergency rollback only!
touch /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/.sync-enabled

# Manual sync
/home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/run-sync-cron.sh

# Verify sync is working
tail -f /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/scripts/logs/sync-auto-*.log
```
