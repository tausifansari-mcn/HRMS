# MAS Callnet PeopleOS / HRMS — Claude Project Instructions

## Product Goal

Build a production-grade MAS Callnet workforce platform for a multi-branch BPO/call-centre organisation, while preserving the modules that already work.

The platform scope is:

- ATS and recruitment lifecycle
- HRMS and complete employee lifecycle
- Attendance, leave, WFM, roster and live tracking
- Payroll, salary slips, statutory compliance, gratuity, tax, PF/UAN/ESIC and full-and-final settlement
- Assets and document management
- Operations and Quality performance
- Resignation and exit management
- Client Portal restricted to each client's mapped process/LOB performance
- Integration Hub and Migration Console
- Controlled ERP extensions: expenses, procurement, vendors, contracts, client billing and finance integration
- Integration with the already deployed internal LMS

Do **not** create a Store Manager role. Use appropriate roles such as Super Admin, HR Admin, Recruitment HR, Finance/Payroll, WFM, Branch Head, Operations Manager, Process Manager, Trainer, QA/T&Q, Employee and Client.

## Current Architecture Baseline — Preserve It

The repository currently contains:

- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/Radix, intended for Vercel.
- Backend: Express + TypeScript under `/backend`, intended for Railway.
- Operational DB: MySQL `mas_hrms`.
- Authentication and storage: Supabase Auth and Storage; some existing frontend-native modules still read Supabase tables.
- Current backend route modules: employees, ATS, leave, payroll foundation, WFM/roster, KPI, portal, exit, integration hub, process and migration.
- Existing Supabase/native pages and SQL foundations for assets, documents, LMS access surfaces, WFM, Quality, Operations, ATS and access control.

Existing functional or partially functional flows must not be discarded. Add an integration, wrapper or migration path before changing any direct-Supabase functionality.

## LMS Integration Rule — Existing Deployed System

The LMS tool has already been independently built and deployed internally. It is a protected existing system and must not be rebuilt from scratch inside this HRMS repository.

The deployed LMS remains the system of record for:

- curriculum, classrooms, modules and learning content;
- learner progress and course/MCQ completion;
- MCQ assessments and question banks;
- trainee questions and answers;
- sequential unlock rules;
- direct learning assignments;
- certification rules and certification decisions;
- trainee/coordinator/admin LMS operational workflows.

HRMS / PeopleOS must integrate the existing LMS through a controlled integration layer, preferably using the existing Integration Hub patterns.

Required HRMS integration outcomes:

- employee-to-LMS learner mapping;
- branch/process/LOB/batch mapping;
- learner progress summary sync;
- MCQ completion and score summary sync;
- certification and Operations handover-readiness sync;
- training risk and attrition summary sync;
- sync audit/error/retry control;
- employee, manager and management dashboard visibility;
- approved aggregate client-portal visibility;
- secure launch/deep-link or SSO feasibility.

Do not:

- build duplicate curriculum/content/assessment/certification edit flows in HRMS;
- delete existing LMS page references until an integration replacement is verified;
- modify or deploy changes to the independently deployed LMS unless the user explicitly authorises it;
- create two competing sources of truth for training or certification data.

## Protected Existing Workflows

Treat these as protected unless the user explicitly approves replacement:

1. Existing employee CRUD, onboarding/profile, attendance, leave, asset UI/hooks, reports, notifications and PWA flows.
2. Existing ATS Candidate Web Form and Recruiter Mobile App flows already used outside this repository; integrate safely, do not break or silently replace.
3. Existing independently deployed LMS and all its working operational flows; integrate only.
4. Existing Client Portal concept: process-scoped client access only, with no payroll/PII leakage.
5. Existing WFM/roster, KPI, exit and Integration Hub work.
6. Existing HRMS/Supabase authentication and stored document flows until a tested migration is available.

## Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

1. Work in one narrowly scoped phase at a time. Never attempt the full PeopleOS build in one change.
2. Before editing, produce: current behaviour summary; exact files to modify/create; database tables/API endpoints affected; risk to working flows; test/rollback plan.
3. Never delete existing functions, routes, tables, page flows, SQL migrations or user-visible options solely to simplify implementation.
4. Never run migrations, destructive SQL, seed/reset operations or deployment commands against production without explicit user approval.
5. Keep migrations additive and backward-compatible. Add new migration files instead of editing already-applied production migrations unless confirmed safe.
6. Backend authorization is mandatory. UI route gating is not security.
7. Sensitive operations must enforce role and row scope at API/query level.
8. Every state-changing action and sensitive export must be auditable.
9. UI enhancement must not hide missing backend functionality.
10. No mock metrics in production flows. Demo tenants/data must be isolated and labelled.
11. Do not push, merge, deploy or update production without user approval.

## Source-of-Truth Direction

| Domain | Authoritative Source / Direction |
|---|---|
| Login/session identity | Supabase Auth |
| File binaries | Supabase Storage initially |
| Employee, ATS, attendance, leave, WFM, payroll, KPI, portal metrics, exit, process masters | MySQL through Express APIs as modules converge |
| Existing Supabase-native modules not yet migrated | Preserve temporarily; document as transitional and migrate module-by-module |
| LMS course/content/assessment/certification operations | Existing deployed LMS only |
| LMS readiness and reporting snapshots in HRMS | Synced from deployed LMS through integration layer |

Do not let the same operational domain be edited independently in two systems without an explicit synchronisation/migration plan.

## High-Priority Audit Targets from the Uploaded Source

Verify these in code before implementing changes:

1. `backend/sql/000_run_all.sql` may omit KPI base schema and Client Portal schema required by mounted services.
2. `backend/src/middleware/requireRole.ts` exists, but route-level authorization and row-scope enforcement require a complete security audit.
3. `backend/src/modules/payroll/payrollCalculate.service.ts` must be reconciled with the `statutory_config` database contract before payroll is treated as reliable.
4. Local development configuration is Supabase/PostgreSQL-centred while Express operational modules depend on MySQL; establish isolated local/staging MySQL testing first.
5. Several `App.tsx` routes use `NativePlaceholderPage`, but that wrapper currently renders real LMS Admin, LMS Management, WFM Live Tracker, Quality and Operations components for matching titles. Do not delete it blindly; refactor only after integration/runtime testing.
6. Asset/document journeys have existing Supabase foundations; build controlled backend convergence rather than removing active flows.
7. Payroll remains a foundation until TDS, gratuity, F&F, salary-advance recovery, payout workflow and statutory outputs are complete.
8. LMS is not a missing backend to rebuild: it is an external deployed system to integrate.

## Required Work Pattern in Claude Code

For every phase:

1. Start in Plan mode.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` and relevant files under `docs/peopleos-build/`.
3. Inspect the actual code/schemas/tests; documentation may be incomplete.
4. Report verified findings and propose a small implementation plan with exact file list.
5. Wait for approval before changing code or database scripts.
6. Implement only the approved scope.
7. Validate frontend/backend builds and relevant tests; migrations only against isolated local/staging schema.
8. Show diff summary, validation output, known limitations and rollback steps.
9. Commit or push only after user approval.

## Initial Delivery Sequence

1. Phase 0: baseline audit, safe local environment, schema runner, authorization, payroll-foundation and routing assessment.
2. Phase 1: organisation masters, role/scope/audit/workflow foundation.
3. Phase 2: employee lifecycle, document and asset backend convergence.
4. Phase 3: ATS, hiring demand, onboarding and candidate-to-employee conversion.
5. Phase 4: attendance, leave, WFM, roster, forecasting, shrinkage and attrition.
6. Phase 5: payroll, statutory, payslip, F&F, gratuity and tax.
7. Phase 6: LMS Integration Layer for the independently deployed LMS; no LMS rebuild.
8. Phase 7: Operations/Quality performance and Call Master integration.
9. Phase 8: Client Portal production hardening and approved LMS readiness summaries.
10. Phase 9: ERP extensions.
11. Phase 10: data migration, security, UAT and deployment readiness.

## Claude Must Not Do Without Explicit Approval

- Deploy to Vercel, Railway, Supabase or the deployed LMS.
- Run MySQL SQL on the production host.
- Reset databases or storage.
- Broadly modify authentication or RLS policies.
- Remove modules, pages, migrations, tables or existing business logic.
- Publish secrets, environment values or client/employee/candidate data.
- Push or merge to GitHub.
