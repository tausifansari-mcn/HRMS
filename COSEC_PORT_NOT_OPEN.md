## ⚠️ Problem

**The firewall rule was NOT applied yet or was applied incorrectly.**

Common reasons:
1. IT whitelisted wrong IP address
2. Rule applied to wrong server
3. SQL Server not listening on 1433
4. VPN required but not connected
5. Firewall change not activated yet

## 🎯 EXACT MESSAGE to Send to IT

```
Subject: URGENT - Port 1433 Still Blocked

Hi IT Team,

I tested the connection to 14.97.30.234:1433 but it's still timing out.

Can you please verify the firewall rule?

Source IPs to whitelist (one of these):
- Public IPv6: 2401:4900:1c62:56ed:f045:ef32:e07e:cf2d
- Local IP:    192.168.1.12
- Gateway IP:  192.168.1.1
- Network:     192.168.1.0/24

OR better: Whitelist the entire office network subnet

Destination:
- IP:   14.97.30.234
- Port: 1433 (TCP)

Test commands showing timeout:
```bash
nc -zv 14.97.30.234 1433
# Result: Connection timed out

telnet 14.97.30.234 1433
# Result: Connection refused/timeout
```

Can you:
1. Verify the firewall rule is active
2. Check if SQL Server is actually running on port 1433
3. Confirm if VPN is required for this connection
4. Test from your side if port is open

Thanks!
```

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### **Option 1: Connect from Office Network**

If you're working remotely, try from office:
- Go to office
- Connect to office WiFi/LAN
- Test again

### **Option 2: VPN Connection**

Ask IT: "Do I need VPN to access internal servers?"

If yes:
```bash
# Connect to VPN first
sudo openvpn --config /path/to/vpn.ovpn

# Then test
nc -zv 14.97.30.234 1433
```

### **Option 3: SSH Tunnel via Jump Server**

If there's a server that CAN reach COSEC:
```bash
# Create SSH tunnel
ssh -L 1433:14.97.30.234:1433 user@jump-server

# Update .env
NCOSEC_DB_HOST=localhost
NCOSEC_DB_PORT=1433

# Test
npx tsx scripts/test-cosec-connection.ts
```

### **Option 4: Check SQL Server Port**

SQL Server might be on a different port:
```bash
# Scan common SQL Server ports
nmap -p 1433,1434,49152-49160 14.97.30.234

# If found on different port (e.g. 49152):
# Update .env
NCOSEC_DB_PORT=49152
```

## 🧪 Quick Tests to Share with IT

Ask IT to run these from THEIR side:

```powershell
# From IT's machine (should work from their side):
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 14.97.30.234 -Port 1433

# Check if SQL Server is running:
Get-Service -Name MSSQL*

# Check SQL Server port:
netstat -ano | findstr 1433
```

## ✅ What to Do NOW

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Call IT** (faster than email):
   - "Port 1433 to 14.97.30.234 is still blocked"
   - "Can you test from your side?"
   - "Do I need VPN?"

2. **While Waiting, Check:**
   ```bash
   # Every 5 minutes, test:
   nc -zv 14.97.30.234 1433
   
   # When you see "succeeded", run:
   cd /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/backend
   npx tsx scripts/test-cosec-connection.ts
   ```

3. **Alternative: Try from Different Network**
   - Try from office if you're remote
   - Try from different WiFi
   - Try mobile hotspot

## 📱 Quick Check Script

Save this to check connectivity every minute:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: check-cosec-port.sh

while true; do
  echo "$(date): Testing 14.97.30.234:1433..."
  
  if timeout 5 nc -zv 14.97.30.234 1433 2>&1 | grep -q "succeeded"; then
    echo "✅ PORT IS OPEN! Running test script..."
    cd /home/shuvam/hrms-audit/backend
    npx tsx scripts/test-cosec-connection.ts
    break
  else
    echo "❌ Still blocked, retrying in 60 seconds..."
    sleep 60
  fi
done
```

Run it:
```bash
chmod +x check-cosec-port.sh
./check-cosec-port.sh
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Port 1433 is NOT open yet.**

You need to:
1. Contact IT urgently
2. Verify firewall rule
3. Confirm IP addresses
4. Check if VPN is needed
5. Test from their side

**Once port is truly open, the scripts will work immediately.**
