# Implementation Summary: Inactive Employee Access & SMS OTP Authentication

**Implementation Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Inactive Employee Read-Only Access (90-Day Grace Period)

**Business Problem Solved:**
- Terminated/inactive employees were completely locked out
- Could not access payslips, tax documents (Form 16), employment certificates
- Created HR dependency and compliance issues

**Solution:**
- 90-day grace period after termination
- Read-only access to personal data
- Database trigger auto-sets grace period
- JWT-based read-only mode enforcement
- Audit logging of all inactive access

**What Inactive Employees Can Access:**
- ✅ View dashboard
- ✅ View and download payslips
- ✅ View and download documents
- ✅ View leave balance and history
- ✅ View attendance history
- ✅ View F&F settlement status
- ✅ View profile (all tabs)

**What is Blocked:**
- ❌ Apply for leave
- ❌ Update profile
- ❌ Upload documents
- ❌ Any state-changing operations

### 2. SMS/OTP Password Reset

**Business Problem Solved:**
- Many employees (blue-collar, shop floor, field staff) lack official email IDs
- Password reset only worked via email
- Created HR workload and access delays

**Solution:**
- Dual-channel forgot password: Email OR SMS/OTP
- 6-digit OTP with 10-minute expiry
- Integrated with existing SMS provider infrastructure
- Works for both active and inactive employees (within grace period)

```bash
# 1. Run migration
mysql -u root -p hrms < backend/sql/215_inactive_access_and_otp_auth.sql

# 2. Make test employee inactive
UPDATE employees SET active_status = 0 WHERE employee_code = 'TEST001';

# 3. Verify grace period was set (should show 90 days)
SELECT employee_code, access_end_date, 
       DATEDIFF(access_end_date, CURDATE()) as days_remaining
FROM employees WHERE employee_code = 'TEST001';

# 4. Login as that employee - should work in read-only mode
# 5. Try SMS/OTP reset - Forgot password > SMS/OTP tab
```
