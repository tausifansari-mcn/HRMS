## Test Type Breakdown

### Unit Tests
**Current**: 34 passing (communication: 16, customization: 18)  
**Needed**: ~500-800 tests across 37 modules

**Priority modules**:
- Payroll: salary calculations, component logic, statutory formulas
- Leave: balance calculations, carry forward, proration
- WFM: attendance rules, shift logic, overtime calculations
- ATS: candidate scoring, offer generation
- Compliance: PF/ESI/PT/TDS calculators

### Integration Tests
**Current**: 15 tests (all skipped due to DB access)  
**Needed**: ~200-400 tests

**Blocked by**: MySQL remote write access denied  
**Solution**: Mock DB or test environment setup

**Priority**:
- Payroll run end-to-end (prep → calc → approval → disbursal)
- Leave request workflow (apply → approval → balance update)
- Attendance session (clock-in → break → clock-out → regularization)
- ATS conversion (candidate → offer → onboarding → employee)
- Exit F&F (resignation → clearance → F&F → final settlement)

### E2E Tests
**Current**: 10 passing (customization scenarios)  
**Needed**: ~50-100 critical user flows

**Priority flows**:
1. Employee onboarding (ATS → offer → onboarding → employee creation)
2. Payroll cycle (attendance → leave → advances → run → payslip)
3. Leave management (apply → approve → balance update)
4. Performance review (goal set → KPI track → review → rating)
5. Exit process (resign → clearance → F&F → final settlement)

## Recommended Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Money Logic (Week 1-2)
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical modules (payroll, leave, wfm, compliance)

**Tasks**:
1. Payroll component calculations (10-15 tests)
2. Statutory deductions (PF/ESI/PT/TDS) (15-20 tests)
3. Leave balance calculations (8-10 tests)
4. Attendance present/absent/LWP logic (10-12 tests)
5. F&F calculations (8-10 tests)

**Total**: ~60-70 unit tests  
**Goal**: Cover all money-handling logic

### Phase 2: Core CRUD + Workflows (Week 3-4)
**Priority**: 🟠 High modules (employees, ats, lifecycle, exit)

**Tasks**:
1. Employee CRUD operations (5-8 tests)
2. ATS candidate lifecycle (10-15 tests)
3. Onboarding workflows (8-10 tests)
4. Exit workflows (8-10 tests)
5. Approval chain logic (5-8 tests)

**Total**: ~40-50 tests  
**Goal**: Core business flows tested

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (Week 5-6)
**Priority**: End-to-end critical paths

**Tasks**:
1. Setup test DB environment (separate schema)
2. Payroll run E2E (prep → calc → approve → disburse)
3. Leave request E2E (apply → approve → balance update)
4. Attendance E2E (clock-in → break → clock-out → regularization)
5. ATS E2E (candidate → offer → onboard → employee)

**Total**: ~20-30 integration tests  
**Blocker**: Need test DB credentials or mock setup

### Phase 4: Edge Cases + Validation (Week 7-8)
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium modules + edge cases

**Tasks**:
1. Date boundary tests (month-end, year-end)
2. Proration tests (mid-year joining/exit)
3. Negative scenarios (invalid data, insufficient balance)
4. Race conditions (concurrent approvals, double submit)
5. Performance tests (bulk operations, large datasets)

**Total**: ~30-40 tests  
**Goal**: Production-hardening

## Test Infrastructure Gaps

### Missing Setup
- [ ] Test database (separate from production)
- [ ] Test data seeding scripts
- [ ] Mock services (email, SMS, WhatsApp)
- [ ] Test fixtures (sample employees, templates)
- [ ] CI/CD test pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage reporting

### Current Blockers
1. **DB Access**: `shivam_user` has no write access from remote IP
   - **Solution**: Create test DB user or use local MySQL instance
2. **No Test Environment**: Tests hitting production DB
   - **Solution**: Separate `.env.test` with test DB credentials
3. **No Mocks**: Real email/SMS/WhatsApp providers called
   - **Solution**: Mock providers for testing
